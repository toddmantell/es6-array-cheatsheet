# es6-array-cheatsheet

A simple repo for documenting the different JS (ES2XXX) array functions and how to use them.  

One of the fastest ways to see the output is to just copy the js into the the babel repl: https://babeljs.io/repl/

(Pasting in the babel repl also shows you the transpiled output to see which functions are part of the language and which still need transpilation.)
